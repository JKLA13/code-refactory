# Code Refctory Homework Assignment #1

Our first homework assignment was all about cleaning up existing code. I did so by performing the following tasks:

- I changed elements tags in index.html to be more in line with semantics of layout requirements.

- I added alt info to <img> tags to ensure accessability requirements.

- I consolidated rule sets with similar properties in the style.css file to clean up redundant, or wet, code.
